							<h2>1300 Reasons Why</h2>
							<p>Amidst the excitement of one of the biggest Technical Fests of the country, we at IEEE-PCS helped many create memories of playing a very distinct game of 1300 reasons why.
							It was conducted on 22nd and 23rd of September and gave the students of VIT along with the external participants an opportunity to prove that they are in fact, a master of all when their abilities were put to test. From finding the optimal solution to a coding problem to scoring the highest in Road Rash along with putting two and two together to complete the Treasure Hunt inside TT, we made sure that the participants have an experience they'll remember.
							We stand proud on making the event a memorable one.</p>
