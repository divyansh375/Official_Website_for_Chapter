						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>  
	“With great communication comes great confidence, greatpowers, and ultimately great success.” This 
	statement might not have an authenticate source, but we at IEEE-Professional Communication Society 
	believe it to the core. Chandler Bing, TyrionLannister, Sheldon Cooper- want to know what they share in 
	common? Contrary to the popular saying, for them, words speak way louder than actions. They might be 
	not be particularly liked by the people they are surrounded with, but definitely adored by everyone else, 
	including us.<br><br>

	We’re IEEE-PCS.<br> 

	The ‘P’ is for Professional. The word speaks for itself. When we work, all of us make sure the work 
	makes us stand apart from the rest. Our professional works is mixed with the appropriate amount of 
	sassiness, which we make sure is displayed in the output. <br> 


	The ‘C’ stands for Communication. Ever wondered what makes a person stand out in a crowd? We 
	believe it is, without a doubt, his/her communication skills. That is what we are all about. We excel in 
	communication, and make sure anyone who approaches us does so too.<br> 

	The ‘S’ is for Society. We’re a team of chaps who, as a team, complete each other. The ever famous 
	finger-fist quote defines us in a nutshell.<br>

	With all things that have been mentioned above, you might arrive at a conclusion that we’re one of those 
	“All Work, No Play” chapters. Trust us, we’ve got the “Play” domain covered as well. <br>

						<h2>Story</h2>
						<p>IEEE Professional Communication Society was established in the year 2011 under the esteemed guidance of faculty coordinator, Dr. Anitha Devi. V. It is recognized as a dynamic body of enthusiastic and technically spirited engineers with a desire to create a change with innovation.

						PCS (Professional Communication Society) is a brother society of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) aimed at improving one’s communication skills in engineering, scientific and other technical environments. 
						The major objective of IEEE PCS is to help engineers, technically to communicate better in their work place both verbally and non-verbally and also promotes and facilitates leading edge education and training in professional environments.

						PCS has conducted a variety of events over the past few years like Cell Tech (Do it yourself workshop), Polyglot, Magnus, Bazinga Reloaded and Scholasticus power which have attracted students from all branches to showcase their communication, technical and management skills.</p>
						<h2>Mission</h2>
						<p>To foster a community which will be dedicated towards the understanding of engineering, scientific, technical environments et al. At the same time, remaining in pursuit of promoting effective communication in all of these dimensions.
The outreach activities of the professional communication society include publishing quotes, running vocabulary building series, posting know our team series in addition to some occasional, witty idioms and proverbs. The weekly editorial insights are what singularly define the chapter's objective whereas, the chapter's blog gives the much-needed platform for its members to express and share their views and opinions. A much clearer perspective on our chapter's functioning can be taken from the chapter's website.</p>

									<p>IEEE-PCS has been the cocoon to my butterfly that has kept me safe and has made sure I am ready for what the future holds. Being a part of this chapter has taught me more than just professional communication, it has taught me the values of life. It’s the people that make the most difference and I can confidently say that PCS has found the best gems of the lot. </p>

									<p>IEEE-PCS is by far the best thing which has happened to me after joining VIT.  Being an introvert for large part of my life, this chapter redefined the inchoate me in the way I look at people, communicate with everyone and above and everything else- taught me how to make lifelong friends. Humility and Punctuality is something which is highly regarded in this chapter, which has shaped all of us of what we are today. This has been a springboard for some wonderful moments spentwith the members and not a single day passes without this hallowed chapter being a part of me and I hope it continues to be so for years to come. Wish this fairytale journey continues forever….</p>

									<p>Communication is the ability to convey thoughts effectively. It by itself is not sufficient to make a man capable, for he must also know how to behave in accordance with the situation. Professionalism is not only dressing presentably but, the art of communicating your thoughts in a concise manner. It is about ethics, etiquette, poise, and foremost accountability.</p>
